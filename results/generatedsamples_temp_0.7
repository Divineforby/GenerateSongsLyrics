Christ is my mind, it's the sail  
The shadows of the war things shine  
I don't want us all sigh  
Reaches and weak page  
In my thought of the blues  
  
Personal carden  
I can't catch the such a time  
(Won't you turn this overcorn)  
Thought it is there's no heart  
Like a floor little shining hand  
Of the women  
Show me what I want to let  
Alright I'm going to  
I see a whole world  
And I'll be right by, baby  
  
I wanna talk to me, don't do it  
I fall away  
  
[Chorus]  
On the morning drinks  
And I can't be worth  
I'm so good to make you  
I can stop the point in the chance  
  
You've got the day that I didn't do to me  
And I'll never be here to make the sand  
We're only you the way to die  
  
Rain of a boy of time  
I got to say that I have remember  
Standing hills and now that I'm never craviced  
But my way to be the madness of my life  
So I'm the one that I know  
  
I can see that I feel alone  
I am so alone and I never wanted to love you  
I can stand in the doves to live  
I just can't see the one I dream anything  
Point of a garder now and the things I see  
I'm not in faith and I'm the groin  
I don't care I only got to make a man  
  
I'm like a little bit of the sound of the life  
I hope you try to be like a different  
I was walking with me  
I say more you like you  
I want to make a rock stried  
I know I'm talking to make me back  
You mean in your head  
But I can see the thing I don't know  
I'm gonna find an ah now I know  
And I can't hear you  
  
I won't try a long time  
Let's mean to be your friends  
I see that you're not the way to do  
I said you'll always be the best you wrong  
  
A little too long  
I need you to set me crime  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't know what I mean  
I found a sun and I do  
I won't find a world to know and go  
I want you to leave any long and I don't know  
I will never see you  
In the color parts from my love  
You can touch me and I do  
I can't explain my mind  
I'm not gonna be your love  
  
I gotta look goodbye  
I make my hand in the seasons  
I don't want to get this morning  
I'm getting it too long  
Just a lot of a disappears of my heart  
I gotta make me get the truth  
What they won't look it what it do  
I'm lookin' to how I feel it all

And thist my life is much  
Let me like you.

I wanna see you so watch you  
(There's nothing to love you)  
I'm a pride (lift)  
I'd be without you  
(I gotta take the destiny)  
I can't live  
I'm gonna lose my baby  
I'm a last love  
I'm gonna do the way  
(That's what I miss)  
I'm not too long, I want to be  
(You're merting of song)  
I ain't there, I never do  
It's so hard to go  
I want you  
No, I'm not found  
You know I don't know  
It's time to be  
I know you don't want to give me your lovin'  
The other sick of the stars  
And I don't have to see  
And I'm gonna do  
You're no time to touch  
  
I'm just a sin of what you wanna say  
What I want it  
What a love won't be in the rain  
Yes I got to want to be waiting for you  
I need you so hard to see you  
I want you  
Where the strong rock and rain  
I never know what I want to stay  
But I could shame what I need  
I got to go away my heart  
A good time I want to see the voice  
I don't care why I do  
But I must be always  
I love you  
I give me up  
I got it all my feet  
So I don't know what I'm not plain  
I don't know me what I do  
I wanna get the way you take my heart  
  
I can see I could take a word  
Honey I've got to go home  
I'm gonna drive my start from what I'm on my own  
  
I don't want no love  
And if I don't care  
You made me down  
I'm a chance  
  
My soul  
I slay  
I'm gonna be my beer  
I'm like a woman  
You got to get your veins  
I'm gonna speak  
  
I don't know what I'll come  
Gonna find it now  
I want to be alive  
I got that those what I've got  
I want to deal and I love you  
  
I'm not so glow  
I don't know where I'm right  
I'm girling on now  
I think I would be your arms  
  
I don't want to love you  
I don't want to hold on  
Dear with the morning  
  
I remember I tried  
I see this hair  
I never make a gone  
And the faremament  
  
I love you  
I'm not a little land  
  
I don't wanna be  
Never know I want a spark  
I know that I won't run  
I saw your shadow  
Just coming around  
I want to be anywhere  
You don't wanna know  
Where I am ever in the stars  
And I never ever thought to know  
Baby I really really got it  
I had a perfect day  
I'm goin' the best that I can  
Wish I want to be your love  
I want to you  
I want to say  
I'm gonna be the only day  
I'll give you free  
The first baby can wait  
  
I'm af you  
I can't get you away  
For a thing that I feel  
To hear me  
  
What's a brand choice  
I wanna feel no probabll  
I just changed  
There's a broken fire  
You can tear the door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For I'm never goinna girl  
I want you to cry  
You can cry  
There's no cold of my heart  
Sometimes I wanna find  
To call my prayer  
I said the playing how I still  
And I will walk away  
  
Take me a thing  
Don't know what to do  
I don't need no more  
I win a partfren is not but you  
I'm still so everything  
All that I'm gonna see  
  
You are the same  
When I love you, done  
That's what I still  
I need you  
  
I was a spark of your feet  
So if I'm going good  
How many missing you now  
And I'm sit in the end  
You're the one so things that I do  
I want you for you  
I'm gonna come on  
I don't want to be you  
I got your heart  
You know I can change it  
But I can seel shining  
To the one who found  
I'm on my mind  
I can't wake up  
One more I did  
  
I need you  
I'm gonna take you  
  
When I'm feeling free  
I don't want to get through  
I'll sing to you  
I want to get home  
I've been told the stand thing  
  
The bells you'd hide  
I've got old windows  
With the thing that I can make it  
I see that I'm too beautiful  
I can take you now  
I know I'll see there  
On the blood of my name  
I got my eyes  
  
I got the long on  
I know I don't know  
The way I have  
I mean in the middle of the road  
I want to get this mind  
I know I know that I got something to bring my start  
I'm in life  
I know that I am alone  
  
I could have no reason  
The diggeating  
I wonder what  
  
If I couldn't see the end of me looking now  
And I do what I would  
I say that I want to say  
I wanna lock you cry  
This is my breath of heaven  
I can stand it at the bot  
  
All I want to say  
I think I'm low  
And when I'm not like the lines  
I saw

I want to live an eye

SAMPLE NUMBER 9 

So I don't want to hear the law of the wind  
And sure is deep in the fire  
How could you hear the bottom  
The sand that's all the lights of me  
  
Are you cared here to  
Deeper, don't you change  
Come on and make the scream  
  
Do you want to be so far  
When you're not what you say  
  
I will wait a real good time  
There's a hard to find anything every day  
I want to think of what you feel  
I'm not there in the burning bruied  
You are wrong all  
And I want to be just to go  
  
It's a girl you live in the sea  
I will see the way they ever calls  
With guilty and the sun  
  
I want this forever  
  
In my world is fighting  
The best thing that I like to  
Everything I know  
I wanna live it in my mind  
I want to be alone  
To drown on down  
I said the truth  
I will see the world  
All I ever think  
Is the teinders light  
  
And I have the eyes  
In my heart is this man  
  
What you would see  
You think I do  
Do my love to me  
  
I want to be free  
I was always  
I have something  
I remember  
I don't know what I want  
  
I was dreaming when I was so far away  
And I love to wish I was so fading for a garden  
I never return the price  
I can't let it what I want  
I will never be the same  
I happen out  
Believe me again  
And I have all this sin  
When I was always saying  
And you try to feel it looking  
  
I true to keep on me  
On an easy  
But the fresh of my life  
I was born in my mind  
And I could see my own way  
  
When I see the one who said  
You said boys  
Who was nowhere to say to you  
I'll be the strength to see  
I have a thousand world  
With you so I turned on  
  
Only begun  
The time  
The prison mountains  
I can understand  
The southern eleeping  
So sharele but my father  
I can see the desire of the way  
  
Was not so laugh  
All I want to be  
When I have care  
I will be so good  
I go  
And then I say  
There's a fool  
Home  
  
I can't tell you  
I'm the best I wanna be  
And I will not dream  
I was calling  
She will take my hide  
And I walk back  
I think I am  
A sun  
I wanna be  
I sit  
I really waste there  
I want to be the place  
I'll be the game  
The wind get out  
  
I feel so hope  
I'll just ask the day  
What is whay I want  
I'm a fool  
I want to stay  
  
And I was gone  
I'm guide on the hall  
And I don't care  
Who's the same  
I miss you  
And I can't do  
I will buy it the cold  
You look so long  
  
I want you to fuck me  
You want me down  
  
I've got to be the ones  
I can be  
  
I've been so long  
To be a girl why  
I don't want to  
  
And I'm gonna be a girl  
For a more fire  
  
Tell me what I mean  
All I wanna sing  
I want to be  
No more old wide  
I wanna feel you  
You know I'll be the one  
I'll do it all  
  
I'm a friend  
I'm a behip this place  
When I want to be you  
If I can tell  
I would never be all  
I want to be alive  
What a man  
The confols did  
If I was burning  
What all I feel  
As the right bright search  
I got the way you do what you do  
Just what I'm burn  
It's all the bed wind  
I know it's just a check  
I want to stand  
'Cause I'm the sun that I told me  
I can care  
I don't care  
I started all for you  
I'm signing  
And I don't know

You gotta tell you think about

So I'm going to say  
I can't care of you
