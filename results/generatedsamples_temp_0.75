You need to taste the world  
But I'm not the sun  
And I was the day they shall look in the starback  
  
The hours sorrow  
  
I'm time I drived the tcure  
I want to say I hate my mind  
The moon is happen to know  
When we can see  
He's a soon of everything  
They say, "I was think that I said  
And I said the music is everything  
But the phone must be anything again  
I got to be handing  
And I beged to follow what I do  
My mind may not to come to me  
  
I was so dream of the town  
My heart all alone  
Pride me mine  
I have not play of my veins  
I would feel the fear  
  
I see home for my loving  
Another wedding I pick up the names  
I want a break the harder  
And they save the heart  
I want to be just a lifetime  
For the world should be friends  
To all of the inside  
A train both books  
My blood start  
And I had one prayer  
He's as far away  
And the end of the star  
  
She a fish and unrest  
With the river fro vent  
  
She said as long  
He was so so come

SAMPLE NUMBER 9 

Oh where the door to the bits  
What will see what's the thing  
They say, "We were treatures  
Would you be the whole world run from the world  
Where are you and me  
It was living when you were such a little thing  
You've got your hands  
But someone who said  
  
We are sick and to the water  
With the racious trieds to be close  
  
[Chorus]  
Or Done  
  
Surfle linger  
They got the good dies through the wind  
  
I was slowly as I can call  
There are peace and get sad  
And to usher the time  
  
Through the doorest times can still cross  
We said her sitting through  
The tricks were placed of town  
And if the soldyman amause  
Action chose to make  
But souls are blues  
And findaway rain  
  
Don't have some off  
  
The song of grace  
Just to grew  
  
It's all the things  
And over all the very fly  
The girls seemed honey  
  
In the music in the day  
Children  
The long home  
And all the things that she's right  
Lord is time again  
It's the one the way around
